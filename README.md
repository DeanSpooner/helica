## Helica: where will you end up?

A demonstration of a "choose your own adventure" game, created in React. This game finds you wake up in a small boat, docked in a cave. Your memories? Gone.

As you explore this region, you will have to make choices that will have consequences on your progress. You will always be presented with two choices: simple, right?
